                <p>
                    Trader Joe’s has developed a unique culture of their brand with their own collection of products and cult following, bringing up the opportunity to cater to their customer base through an application. With this in mind, we worked on a Trader Joe’s app across the course of six weeks.

                <h5>UNDERSTANDING: LITERATURE REVIEW</h5>
                <h3>Trader Joe’s Website</h3>
    
                <p>We began by exploring the <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home">Trader Joe’s website</a> to learn how the brand currently caters to its consumer base and find  potential opportunities for improvement. We learned that the website mainly focuses on promoting its new products, recipes, and places a heavy emphasis on promoting its marketing tools such as their podcast, newsletter, and Fearless Flyer, the brand’s promotional flyer. </p>

                <img src="images/tjwebsite.png" alt="Trader Joe's Website" style="filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1));">

                <p>
                    We also compared the Trader Joe’s website with similar grocery store websites using Similarweb, a traffic analysis tools, to see how the current website is doing in comparison to its competition. 
                </p>

                <img src="images/tjlitreviewnumbers.svg" alt="Trader Joe's Website">

                <p>
                    The Trader Joe’s website receives <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">significantly less traffic compared to other grocery store websites</span>. This is quite shocking considering Trader Joe’s has over 2.9 million followers on Instagram but Whole Foods which has a similar amount of followers as Trader Joe’s with 3 million followers has more double the amount of monthly users on their website. In addition, Trader Joe’s hashtag on TikTok has over 4 billion total views while Whole Foods has only 844 million. From this we can see that Trader Joe’s has a much larger 
                    <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">Gen Z and millennial fanbase</span> and the current Trader Joe’s website is not captivating enough for them. With these two demographics being a mobile first generation, we decided to create a 
                    <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">mobile app that better caters to their needs</span>
                    .

                <h5>UNDERSTANDING: LITERATURE REVIEW</h5>
                <h3>What Makes Trader Joe’s Unique?</h3>
    
                <p>We conducted some literature reviews on the Trader Joe’s brand to understand how we can personalize an app that reflects its unique qualities. According to Forbes and CNBC, Trader Joe’s sets itself apart from the competition by placing emphasis on constantly improving its in-store experience in the form of friendly staff members, customer-first model, low prices, hand-drawn signs, and unique products just to name a few. To reflect the brand’s values, we placed the emphasis of the app on <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">enhancing the in-store experience</span>.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 40px; font-weight: 600;">How might we enhance the Trader Joe's store experience through efficiency and brand familiarity with an app?</p>
    
                    <p>With numerous grocery store apps available, distinguishing our app from the rest posed a challenge. Our objective was to embody the unique Trader Joe's brand and aesthetic by striking a balance between visual appeal and functionality.</p>

                <h5>USER RESEARCH: SURVEY</h5>
                <h3>Hearing From Our Users</h3>
    
                <p>
                    For our primary research, we conducted a survey because it enabled us to gather the most data in the least amount of time and reach various demographics. First, we wanted to learn about users’ basic background information to understand the makeup of our respondents, and it will become useful when we select potential interviewees. Next, we wanted to learn about their grocery shopping experience, such as which stores they prefer and why, as well as, whether they use any existing grocery store apps. Finally, we wanted to see how they engage or not engage with existing grocery store apps and what they are looking for in a good grocery store app. We made sure to not word questions that may result in bias or include any leading questions.
                </p>

                <P>
                    We created the survey on Qualtrics and began collecting data by sharing our QR code and URL with our peers and posting them on various Trader Joe’s fans Facebook group pages, as well as, canvassing at our local Trader Joe’s. Over the span of 2 weeks, we collected over <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">225 responses</span>.
                </P>

                <h4>Survey Demographics</h4>

                <p>
                    As college students we distributed the survey with many of our peers, thus 79% of our respondents are between the <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">ages of 18-25</span>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My team and I conducted 5 user interviews who ranged from loyal Trader Joe’s fans to casual shoppers about their Trader Joe's experience and asking them to walk us through their journey of before, during, and after their shopping trip. Common key words mentioned by our interviews included <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">lack of availability, forgetfulness, crowdedness, and lack of community</span>. More about this will be elaborated down below.

                <p>
                    We also created a user journey map to visualize the journey a typical TJ shopper may take from before they shop to after they shop to better understand how they may feel and act during each stage. Through this process, we found many potential user pain points and helped us better empathize with our users.

                <h3>Pain Points and Solutions</h3>
    
                <p>
                    From our affinity map, we developed four main pain points and began to ideate solutions for each pain point.

                <p>
                    Brought up during our survey, interviews, and user journey, not knowing whether a product was in stock was the most common pain point. Due to its constant change in selection and consistently sold out products, many users have gone to Trader Joe's only to find products out of stock or pulled from shelves.

                    We added an indicator on the home screen and product page to show whether a product is in stock, low in stock, or out of stock, so even before going to Trader Joe’s, shoppers can check a product’s availability and plan ahead. Shoppers can also turn on alerts to be reminded about product availability.

                <p>
                    There were some common pain points that we chose not to focus on for this sprint because they were not compatible with Trader Joe’s and did not align with their branding.
                </p>

                <div class="row5">
                    <div class="row5-1">

                        <h4>Deals & Discounts</h4>
                    </div>
    
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            From our research, we learned that users care most about price when shopping at Trader Joe's and mainly use other grocery store apps to find deals and discounts; however, we chose not to focus on this pain point to 
                            <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">stay true to Trader Joe's branding</span> because Trader Joe's almost never has any deals and prides itself as having some of the lowest prices in the market.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            One popular feature that our survey respondents wanted to see in a grocery store app was the location of the product. However, though this may be useful for other grocery stores, this would not fit well with Trader Joe's due to the following reasons:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Trader Joe's <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">does not currently have an existing store organization system </span> unlike Target or Safeway which label their aisles. We did not want to invent a new store organization system which would confuse users.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Trader Joe's prides itself in its excellent store experience, thus the goal is to <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">have shoppers naturally walk around the store</span>  and explore all of its products.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                The <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">store is so small</span> that users can easily find all the items they need with minimal effort.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    We conducted 4 usability tests on our mid-fidelity prototype, by having users complete 3 sets of tasks for each stage of the grocery shopping process to test the user’s ability to navigate the app and learn about their overall first impressions.

                        <p>
                            The shopping list was initially designed to be a one-time use list for each shopping trip. However, users shared that they usually get the same items each time and it is time-consuming to keep creating new lists each time. Thus, we refined our shopping list to be reusable.

                        <p>
                            Based on user feedback, we learned that our users cared more about what their friends had to say about a product rather than that of the general public. Thus, we edited the Social Page to focus more on staying up-to-date on their friends’ opinions about products and activity.

                    We presented our project to a panel of industry professionals on Presentation Day, an event hosted by Design Interactive, the first UX organization at UC Davis. We were awarded the <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">Audience Choice Award</span> and the <span style="color:#B8322E; font-weight: 700;">Best Storytelling Award</span>

                <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
                <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    
                <p>
                    This was my first time being user research lead and it was quite intimidating since I have never lead any part of a design sprint before; however, it proved to be a valuable experience as now I gained experience delegating tasks, spearheading user research, and experimenting with various methods to gather data. This was also my first time using Qualtrics and it definitely changed the game for me when it comes to creating surveys as there is a lot more customization that I can do, as well as, different ways to display data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another important skill I learned was working with a design system. Previously, I had a poor habit of designing without a comprehensive design system, which resulted in unconsistent designs especially when I worked with other team members. Though creating the design system did take time, it proved to be extremely useful in making sure all of our designs were uniform and changes could easily be made.

                <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
    
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was that we had many features in mind (i.e. socials page with poll voting, featured customer reviews, having different grocery lists) and had a difficult time eliminating/reorganize these features. Hi-fi prototyping was also quite challenging since this was the first time I had to do any difficult prototyping on Figma. However, I think that by being Hi-fi lead, it really pushed me to learn and experiment with the prototype tools in Figma, and overall was a great learning experience.

            <section>
                <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    
                <p>
                    Given more time, I would like to focus on interviewing more loyal fans of Trader Joe’s as opposed to just casual shoppers. I would also like to conduct more usability tests on the high fidelity prototype to improve the user flow. In addition, I would also like to develop the following features that my team and I previously ideated but were not able to get to:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Expand Social Page to promote interaction between friends such as the addition of collaborative Collections.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Build out the Recipes Page and allow users to submit recipes to be highlighted on the Recipes Page
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Add a feature that allows customers to report product availability for better accuracy
                    </li>
                </ol>
